<div class="div1">
<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This document provides an overview of the OpenSPML 2.0 Toolkit, a collection
    of Java classes that assist in submitting OASIS SPML 2.0 (SPML2) requests and
    receiving SPML2 responses. There are also classes in the toolkit that assist in
    the implementation of servlet-based SPML2 servers.</p>

<p>The toolkit is not vendor specific, it may be used by any Java application to
    communicate with any SPML2 compliant server. Again, it may also be used by an
    SPML2 server to parse requests and build responses.</p>

<p>A Java object model is provided for all of the request and response elements
    defined in the SPML2 protocol. This includes the core requests and all of the
    standard capabilities. In addition, a (very simple) set of classes to perform
    SOAP communication is also provided. This provides Java developers with a
    convenient mechanism to make SPML2 requests without having to worry about the
    details of the XML language, SOAP, or the HTTP transport protocol.</p>

<p>This new version of the toolkit is designed to be pluggable, in part to make
    supporting the "profiles" of SPML 2.0 simpler; but to also allows you to plug-in
    different SOAP providers, different XML parsers, and you should be able to use
    different XML to Java binding tools (e.g. JAXB) to support the XML Schema
    profile.</p>

<p>This document provides only an overview of the available classes. Please
    consult the Javadocs (in
    <root>/docs/apis) for more detailed information.
</p>

<div class="div1">
    <h2><a name="Installation And Use">Installation and Use</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Currently, the distribution includes the following jar files (in the
    &lt;root&gt;>/lib directory): </p>

<p><b>openspml2-toolkit.jar</b>: contains the class files for the OpenSPML 2.0
    Toolkit.</p>

<p>The jar file is normally installed in the WEB-INF/lib directory of your web
    application. If you wish to use only the client portion of the library, you may
    put openspml2-toolkit.jar anywhere and include it in the client application's
    classpath.</p>

<p>The library requires some other libraries, these are included in the
    distribution in the tools directory. They should also be made available to
    servers and clients. (You'll note that one of these in the openspml.jar from the
    1.0 toolkit. We'll eventually remove this dependency.)</p>

<p>Here's an example web.xml (just the pertinent parts) that uses a service
    like 'dev/null' to handle requests. This should server as a starting point.</p>

<pre>
    &lt;servlet&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt;openspmlRouter&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;display-name&gt;OpenSPML SOAP Router&lt;/display-name&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;A router of RPC traffix - nominally SPML 2.0 over SOAP&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;servlet-class&gt;

        &lt;/servlet-class&gt;

        &lt;/init-param&gt;
    &lt;/servlet&gt;

    &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt;openspmlRouter&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/openspml2&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</pre>


<div class="div1">
    <h2><a name="Project Goals">Project Goals</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Apart from supporting the new version of the protocol, we also had some other
    goals.</p>

<p>We wanted to carry forward the good things about the 1.0 toolkit, namely:

    <ul>

        <li>Separation between protocol and SPML handlers</li>

        <li>Protocol handler registration via servlet properties</li>

        <li>'Plug-in' and registration mechanism for provider-specific server
            implementation via SPMLHandler interface
        </li>

    </ul>
</p>

<p>We wanted to make the toolkit more open - dropping some things; like:

    <ul>

        <li>relies on DOM - we now allow you readily replace the parser
            implementation.
        </li>

        <li>too many things named handler - hopefully the naming is improved.</li>

        <li>SOAP toolkit agnostic - a replaceable layer in the toolkit knows about SOAP.
            You could readily use any SOAP toolkit you'd like.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>We have added, or intend to add, the following items to the kit:

    <ul>

        <li>a comprehensive example of a provider/server</li>

        <li>interoperability test suites, hitting live server(s)</li>

        <li>if there's to be a standard schema, use it in the examples and suites</li>

        <li>documentation, like javadoc, tutorials, and quick start guides.</li>

        <li>perhaps some infrastructure like logging; or at least a coherent exception
            handling model/strategy.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div class="div1">
    <h2><a name="Toolkit Layers and Packages">Toolkit Layers and Packages</a></h2>
</div>

<p>The toolkit services are layered and the package names that mirror the
    layers. Where appropriate they also mirror the specification.</p>

<p>This section names the layers and the package(s) that represent those layers.
    Generally, we are starting at the top of the layering and working down through
    to the dependencies. In other words, the first package listed should only be
    dependent on the next package listed.</p>

<p>We provide a list of the interesting classes in each package (not alsways
    complete), with short descriptions. The Javadoc is a more definitive set of
    information.</p>

<p>A note on class naming... there are a fair number of interfaces in the
    toolkit. We often define "starter" classes that are meant to be used as a base
    for the implementation of an interface. These classes are usually abstract and
    are named Basic&lt;interfacename&gt;. So, if we have an interface named "Foo", the
    "BasicFoo" class is the corresponding starter. This starter class may not be in
    the same package as the interface. Additionally, we often preface classes with
    "Simple"; which is meant to indicate that this is an example class that may not
    be implemented robustly enough to use in a production server, but it should
    communicate the basics of what the "real" implementation should look like.</p>

<h3>Web Service Layer</h3>

<p><i>(org.openspml.v2.transport)</i></p>

<p>Here's where determine how communication will happen. We don't assume much
    about the transport layer; while we do provide an example of using HttpServlet
    and SOAP as the transport - it should be possible to implement different
    transport protocols.</p>

<p><i>RPCDispatcher</i></p>

<p>Implement this interface in order to to implement an RPC API. We implement it
    to support SPML2 via SOAP.</p>

<pre>
  public void init(RPCRouter router, Map config) throws Spml2TransportException;
  public String dispatchRequest(String message) throws Spml2TransportException;
</pre>

<p><i>RPCRouter</i></p>

<p>This is an interface that can be monitored, and implementation should
    manage RPCDispatcher objects.</p>

<p><i>RPCRouterMonitor</i></p>

<p>An interface to allow the monitoring of the messages flowing through the
    router.</p>

<p><i>RPCRouterMonitorListener</i></p>

<p>Monitors tell listeners when they close.</p>

<p><i>RPCRouterServlet</i></p>

<p>An implementation of the RPCRouter interface that is also an HttpServlet.
    This also manages dispatchers, the default being one that knows how to take SOAP
    to SPML2 and back.</p>

<p><i>SPMLViaSOAPDispatcher</i></p>

<p>Implements the RPCDispatcher interface. This adapts from the world of the
    transport to the provider. Maintains a list of marshallers,and executors. The
    marshallers convert the transport data to XML and back.</p>

<H3>Provider Layer (SPML2 domain)</H3>

<p><i>(org.openspml.v2.provider)</i></p>

<p>This is where the provider implementation begins. The classes here receive
    the data from the transport layer and manipulate it. For example, SPMLMarshaller
    implementations move XML to Java and back.</p>

<p><i>SPMLMarshaller</i></p>

<p>An interface that receives Strings (SPML2) and returns SPMLRequest objects.
    These can also convert Response objects back to Strings (SPML2).</p>

<pre>
  public void init(Map config) throws Spml2Exception;
  public String getUniqueName();
  public Request unmarshallRequest(String msg) throws Spml2Exception;
  public String marshallResponse(Response res) throws Spml2Exception;
</pre>

<p><i>SPMLExecutor</i></p>

<p>An interface that processes Java objects (Request/Response). Implementations
    can redispatch them to other SPMLExecutor objects or could do the work directly.
    One might define an SPMLExecutor that takes a request, introspects on it, and
    calls a private method that implements the funtionality. Alternatively, one
    might define an executor that looks at the request and dispatches to a
    sub-executor that performs the operation. In the former case, the methods
    implement the operations, in the latter, the sub-handlers implement the
    operations.</p>

<pre>
  public Response execute(Request request) throws Spml2Exception;
</pre>

<H3>Open Content Support</H3>

<p><i>(org.openspml.v2.msg)</i></p>

<p>The SPML2 .xsds allow for <em>Open Content</em> in the object (i.e xsd:any
    for elements and attributes). The toolkit therefore has to allow for Java
    classes that represent this content. We do this by allowing clients of the
    toolkit to implement the OpenContentAttr and OpenContentElement interfaces.
    The latter is the more interesting.</p>

<p>We also use the Adapter pattern; providing an interface called
    OpenContentElementAdapter, and 2 default implementations that allow us to manage
    objects of type Marshallable and String (raw xml) as OpenContent.</p>

<p>Again, these implementations:
    <ol>
        <li>Manage objects implementing our Marshallable interface as OpenContent.
            Marshallable implementations can be hooked into the toolkit classes to become
            first-class citizens of the toolkit.
        </li>

        <li>Manage Strings of XML as OpenContent, allowing you to do your own
            marshalling/unmarshalling.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The string adapter is only enabled if you set the
    <b>"org.openspml.v2.adaptXMLStrings"</b> system property.</p>

<p>The other classes of interest in this package are XMLMarshaller and
    XMLUnmarshaller. These are the interfaces that we implement to actual bind XML
    to Java objects and back. These are what you would implement to replace, for
    example, our example classes that use Xerces DOM, with a different parser or
    parser model.</p>

<h3>Core, Capabilities and Profiles</h3>

<p>(subpackages of <i>org.openspml.v2.msg and org.openspml.v2.profiles</i>)</p>

<p>This section will discuss the contents of the subpackages of the .msg
    package. These contain the Java classes that are specified in the .xsd files of
    the standard distribution. Each package is named according to its prefix in
    these .xsds.</p>

<p>Since the key thing to know is where to find the classes, we won't list all
    the classes in each package here. You can refer to the Javadoc for that.</p>

            <P>This package is meant to hold ProfileRegistrar implementations. These
                classes are used to configure the system (via ObjectFactory) to use the
                desired profiles. The DSMLProfileRegistrar is the one example.</P>

                to add your own Java Binding classes into the toolkit. We want to
                allow the use of tools like JAXB and XmlBeans with the toolkit.</P>

<h4>Example: Registering the DSML Profile</h4>

<p>This is an example of telling the system that you want to use the DSML profile.</p>

<pre>
<code>
    import org.openspml.v2.profiles.DSMLProfileRegistrar;
    import org.openspml.v2.util.xml.ObjectFactory;

    public class MySPMLv2Requestor {

    public static void main(String args[]) {

    ...

    // register the profile for DSML (do this even before listTargets!)
    ObjectFactory.getInstance().register(new DSMLProfileRegistrar());

    ...
    }

    }
</code>
</pre>

<p>The implementation of the DSML classes is fairly straight-forward. In short,
    they simply implement the <em>OpenContentElement</em> interface and are
    then plugged into the system. Have look in the &lt;root&gt;/src/java/... tree
    for details.</p>

<p>One more note. Our Java bindings use a Reflection-based protocol to make
    these apis easier to write by hand. Because of this, some of the field names in
    the classes may look a little odd; but hopefully the comments in the code are
    sufficient to explain this.</p>

    <h2><a name="Communication Classes">Communication Classes</a></h2>
</div>

<p><i>org.openspml.v2.client</i> - This package has classes that are used to
    talk to an SPML server via SOAP. They are simple - meant mostly as examples.
    They do not use any libraries other than the JDK.</p>

<p><i>SimpleSOAPClient</i></p>

<p>A class providing a simplified interface for making message-oriented SOAP
    requests.</p>

<p><i>Spml2Client</i></p>

<p>A class providing a mechanism to send and receive SPML2 requests using the
    msg.spml.Request and msg.spml.Response classes. Once the request is formatted as
    XML, it uses the SimpleSOAPClient class to handle the actual communication. When
    the XML response is received, it is unmarshalled into a Response and
    returned.</p>

<div class="div1">
    <h2><a name="Utility Classes">Utility Classes</a></h2>
</div>

<p><i>org.openspml.v2.util</i> and <i>org.openspml.v2.util</i> - These two
    packages contain classes that implement some of the toolkit interfaces, mostly
    as examples, and might also be generally useful throughout the rest of the
    toolkit. Rather that enumerate all of them, we refer you to the Javadoc. We do
    describe a couple of the more important classes.</p>

<p><i>org.openspml.v2.util.xml.ObjectFactory</i></p>

<p>This class is a Singleton; and it is used to hook new OpenContent bindings
    classes (in particular, implementations of Marshallable and OpenContentElement)
    into the toolkit. It defines a couple of inner-interfaces that allow this.
    Please see the Javadoc.</p>

<p><i>org.openspml.v2.util.xml.OperationalNameValuePair</i></p>

<p>We provide a class that implements the <i>OpenContentElement</i> interface (and
    uses the MarshallableElemenent/Marshallable reflection based binding protocol)
    and can be used by clients to pass server-specific operational attributes (perhaps
    auth-tokens) in the SPMLv2 requests. This is <b>not</b> part of the specification,
    but it is useful to pass information "out-of-band".</p>

<p>This class is always available in the toolkit. It's always known to the
    ObjectFactory.</p>

<p><i>org.openspml.v2.util.EnumConstant</i></p>

<p>This is the base class for the Enums that are defined in the .xsd files (e.g.
    StatusRequest). This class made it easy to write Java bindings for these
    portions of the .xsd. If you are using the XML Shema profile, you might find
    this useful - along with the Reflection based binding protocol that we use in
    the toolkit.</p>
